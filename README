Dbg is a utility to log debug output and is designed to work within the Unity3D editor's Console

By using [Conditional("UNITY_EDITOR")], it allows debug log calls to be "stripped" away 
when building to the target platform.
 
Dbg is also designed around logging to a channel so that user can selectively watch
the channel that they are interested in.
 
Example Usage:

on a Start() or Awake() method call
     Dbg.SetDebugChannel(Dbg.eChannelType.PLAYER, true);  // this will turn on the PLAYER channel

now one can call:
     Dbg.Log(Dbg.eChannelType.PLAYER, "display something that can help you debug" );
     Dbg.LogMethodCall(Dbg.eChannelType.PLAYER);          // to log the method you are in
     Dbg.Assert( needsToBeTrue, "ok, we got an assert");  // this will pause the editor if needsToBeTrue is false
